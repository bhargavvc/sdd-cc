## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `sdd-new-workspace` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{SDD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{SDD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing SDD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<context>
**Flags:**
- `--name` (required) — Workspace name
- `--repos` — Comma-separated repo paths or names. If omitted, interactive selection from child git repos in cwd
- `--path` — Target directory. Defaults to `~/sdd-workspaces/<name>`
- `--strategy` — `worktree` (default, lightweight) or `clone` (fully independent)
- `--branch` — Branch to checkout. Defaults to `workspace/<name>`
- `--auto` — Skip interactive questions, use defaults
</context>

<objective>
Create a physical workspace directory containing copies of specified git repos (as worktrees or clones) with an independent `.planning/` directory for isolated SDD sessions.

**Use cases:**
- Multi-repo orchestration: work on a subset of repos in parallel with isolated SDD state
- Feature branch isolation: create a worktree of the current repo with its own `.planning/`

**Creates:**
- `<path>/WORKSPACE.md` — workspace manifest
- `<path>/.planning/` — independent planning directory
- `<path>/<repo>/` — git worktree or clone for each specified repo

**After this command:** `cd` into the workspace and run `/sdd-new-project` to initialize SDD.
